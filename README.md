# NFL Database Final Project (CPSC 437)

Teammates: SK Bong and Vivek Gopalan

In this repository, we have the data, DDL (for the database), and other code that was used to complete the project:

## Data

The data (scraped from `www.pro-football-reference.com`) is stored in each of the folders (for each year from 2002 to 2020). We restricted it to this range because teams have not changed since 2002 (minus some small location/name changes) which made it possible to compare the data for these years. The data in this repository is organized as follows:
* Year (e.g. 2020)
  * AFC.csv - season team statistics for teams in the American Football Conference
  * NFC.csv - season team statistics for teams in the National Football Conference
  * coaches.csv - coaches and their team/career/playoffs records
  * draft.csv - the order of players drafted
  * games.csv - information on the schedule of games played (with points and yards)
    * playoff_results.csv - same except for playoffs (information duplicated in games.csv)
  * defense.csv, kicking.csv, passing.csv, receiving.csv, returns.csv, rushing.csv - corresponding statistics per player
* DPOY.csv - Defensive Player of the Year award winners (year, name, team name, position)
* MVP.csv - Most Valuable Player award winners (year, name, team name, position)
* OPOY.csv - Offensive Player of the Year award winners (year, name, team name, position)
* stadiums.csv - Stadium name, years it was used, city, state, and teams that used the stadium

To view how we scraped the data, please see `scraper.ipynb`.

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

The DDL for our database schema can be found in `nfl_ddl.sql`.

## Data Cleaning and Insertion

To insert the data into our database, we used a jupyter notebook `Table_Cleaning.ipynb` to clean and modify the scraped data into the desired format. This notebook uses sqlalchemy to create a SQL engine that connects to our database which can be used with the `to_sql()` function to insert the data from pandas dataframes.

## Streamlit Webpage

The webpage was created using streamlit (source code can be found in `streamlit_app.py`). Here, we retrieved the data from our database using the pandas `read_sql()` function and a query. These queries are then used to create a visualization which ranges from barplots and scorigami charts to a nice interactive table where the user can order the rows based on any column.

The page should be available at https://share.streamlit.io/vvkgopalan/cpsc437_project.

To run the streamlit webpage locally, run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` from the command line.
